# Senior Design Project D

##### Description: A Python tool used to take a screenshot of an image, perform image processing on it, and generate an HTML \<img\> tag to uniquely identify it. This tool also allows for images to be compared for similarity based on the alternate text of each image and based on how similar each image is qualitatively. The program can also extract text that is within an image and compare this to the extracted text of another image.
